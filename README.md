# wannaweb
========
Test effort to put java program with javadoc onto github (and gh-pages)

Note: "GitHub serves static HTML files that are in the gh-pages branch of your 
repo as http://your_username.github.io/your_repo/ ." 
E.G: https://mroam.github.io/wannaweb
(Note: it used to be username.github.com but now has "io" instead of "com".
Also, repo branches can be reached by a button appear under the "< > Code" menu, 
and are usually "master" (or "main"?) and "gh-pages".)

## Questions: 

[x] How does N see the gh-pages "branch" of wannaweb?? 
repo branches can be reached by a button appear under the "< > Code" menu, 
and are usually "master" (or "main"?) and "gh-pages".)

[x]Does mike have to explicitly share that branch? Don't think so.

[x] Can we edit html pages on github from web browser? Yes: switch to gh-pages branch and edit through github. (In the same way we're editing this readme)

[] Do N's changes to wannaweb's readme show up on mike's main branch? on mike's gh-pages branch??

[] Can we control the power of collaborators?

[] How do we put line endings or returns that matter?
