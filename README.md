wannaweb
========
Questions: 
[]How does N see the gh-pages "branch" of wannaweb?? Does mike have to explicitly share that branch?
[]Can we edit html pages on github from web browser? (In the same way we're editing this readme)
[]Do N's changes to wannaweb's readme show up on mike's main branch? on mike's gh-pages branch??

test effort to put java program with javadoc onto github (and gh-pages)
